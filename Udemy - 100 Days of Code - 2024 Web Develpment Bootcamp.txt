Introduction [Day 1]
We send a request via HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

Request: you, the client, requests something from the server Client, Front-end
Response: the server, response, to your request              Server, Back-end

Programming Languages
HTML: the content structure of the displayed page
CSS: the styling of the displayed page and its content
JavaScript: interactivity that might might be needed on the displayed page

Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
https://www.google.com
protocol://root-domain.domain/path

DNS Server: stores domain and the translation tables
Your browser first looks up the DNS lookup request, and the DNS Response with an IP address
To host a website, appropriate "Entry Points" (Ports) must be opened in the network and your computer must be configured as a web server

Using fonts from Google fonts
https://fonts.google.com/

1.) Type the name of the font family you want
2.) Select the size(s) you want of the font
3.) Get the link of the font(s) you want
4.) Place the link in your <head></head> tag as the first link
5.) In you CSS file use the font-family
p {
    font-family: 'Fira Sans'
}

for performance reasons it is probably best to download the files directly to your server

border-radius is based on the size of your image
height: 200px;
width: 200px;
border-radius: 100px;   //basically a circle
